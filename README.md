# fortran-mpi-snippets README
I found it's diffcult to autocomplete the fortran mpi code in VScode.

I write the snippets to ficilite the coding.

The MPI funciton was get from the offical web of [Microsoft MPI reference documention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi).

The script is a spider that can search the webpage and collecte the funciton and relevent description.
